## DiscordDevBadgeBot
This program will allow you to get discord active developer badge.

## Usage
1. Go to the [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), sign in, and click `New Application`. Choose any name, click accept and create. Next go to the `Bot` section and click `Add Bot`. Click on `Reset Token` and click on `Copy` button.
- **IMPORTANT:** DO NOT share copyed token! Others can use this to control your bot!
- **IMPORTANT:** DO NOT close the terminal window until you complete step 4.
2. Download the zip code and unzip it. Next run `BadgeBot.exe` and (or just use bot.py, but I recommend you to use BadgeBot.exe for simplicity) use `CTRL + V` to paste token of your bot and press `Enter`.
3. Now you will see that you got the invite link for your bot that you want to open by pressing `CTRL + LMB`. On the following menu you will have to choose the server that you want to use as your badge server and invite the bot.
- **IMPORTANT:** DO NOT use any server you are using for anything other than getting this badge!
4. Now go to the server where the bot is and use the `/hello` slash command in any text channel (after completing this step you can close the terminal window).
- **IMPORTANT:** You have to wait now 24 hours for discord to proces that you used command on your bot before proceding to next step!
- **IMPORTANT:** You need to have `Use data to improve Discord` enabled within `User Settings` > `Privacy & Safety`. At least 24 hours need to pass after enabling this setting before using command. For more info check [this article](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10113997751447).
5. After 24 hours, open [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/active-developer) and fill out the form that will allow you to claim the badge.
- **IMPORTANT:** If you don't run the command again in 30 days after claiming  badge, it will be removed from your account!
